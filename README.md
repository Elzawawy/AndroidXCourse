## Assignments
### Assignment 1: GeoQuiz
Originally from "Android Programminbg- The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" Chapter 1. 
The application you are going to create is called GeoQuiz. GeoQuiz tests the user’s knowledge of
geography. The user presses True or False to answer the question on screen, and GeoQuiz provides
instant feedback.

### Assignment 2: The Cheating GeoQuiz
Originally from "Android Programminbg- The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" Chapter 5. 
You will add a second activity to GeoQuiz. An activity controls a screen of information,
and this activity will add a second screen that offers users a chance to see the answer to the current
question.
Why is this a good Android programming exercise? You will learn how to:
• Create a new activity and a new layout for it.
• Start an activity from another activity. Starting an activity means asking the OS to create an
activity instance and call its onCreate(Bundle) method.
• Pass data between the parent (starting) activity and the child (started) activity.
• Also, we add Lifecycle Callbacks and use Logcat to better understand the activity lifecycle.
